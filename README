CompCert Extensions
===================

The directories 'Untrusted_Transformations' and 'Trusted_Validators' contain
respectively OCaml implementation of optimizations and Coq formally verified
translation validators that extend the Compcert compiler. 

These files are not maintained anymore and are meant to be used as a source
of code to extend Compcert. (It's a 'framework'.)
